### 👋 About

I focus on hands-on offensive security and practical penetration testing. Most of my time is spent breaking systems in controlled lab environments so I can understand how they fail and how to make them more secure.

I work across Linux and Windows machines, web applications, internal networks, and identity-based environments, practicing real-world techniques like privilege escalation, lateral movement, and post-exploitation. I document what I learn through tools, scripts, and writeups that I share publicly.

Everything here is built for learning, research, and improving security in a responsible and ethical way.

### Core Capabilities

- End-to-end offensive security assessments across Linux and Windows environments  
- Web application exploitation and internal network compromise  
- Active Directory attack paths, privilege escalation, and lateral movement  
- Wireless security testing and internal threat simulation  
- Secure development with focus on attack surface reduction  
- Custom tooling for reconnaissance, exploitation, and automation
