**_Offensive Security | Red Team Operations | Adversary Simulation_**

---

### Overview

Offensive security practitioner with a foundation in software development and a strong focus on hands‑on attack simulation. I actively study and practice real‑world offensive techniques across web applications, internal networks, Active Directory environments, wireless systems, and Linux‑based infrastructures.

My work is driven by disciplined experimentation, tool‑building, and continuous learning. I focus on understanding attacker behavior in depth — how systems fail, how defenses respond, and how small weaknesses compound into real security risks. I build and test in controlled environments with an emphasis on ethics, precision, and technical growth.

### Core Capabilities

- End-to-end offensive security assessments across Linux and Windows environments  
- Web application exploitation and internal network compromise  
- Active Directory attack paths, privilege escalation, and lateral movement  
- Wireless security testing and internal threat simulation  
- Secure development with focus on attack surface reduction  
- Adversary emulation aligned with red team methodologies  
- Custom tooling for reconnaissance, exploitation, and automation

### 🧩 Digital Challenge

> **Think you understand hacking?**
> Then try to decode the shadows I leave behind. This isn’t about certs or trophies.
> It’s about mastery through silence, logic, and will.

```python
# Challenge: decrypt the essence behind mastery
from hashlib import sha256 as h
from itertools import product as p

f = lambda s, r: [h((b+k).encode()).digest() for _ in range(r) for b,k in [s]][-1].hex()
c = lambda: [f(x,7) for x in p(['AD','WiFi','Embedded','Web','Net'],['recon','pivot','exploit','evade','persist'])]
s = [x for x in c() if x.startswith('00')]

print("Skill encoded in shadows. Decode if you dare." if len(s) > 3 else "Keep digging, no shortcuts here.")
```

> 💡 [Check the patterns](https://jusot99.github.io) if you're serious.
> The truth isn't printed — it's encrypted.

```markdown
> 🧠 The real patterns aren’t in the code — they’re on the wire.  
> 💡 Trace the signals across my website. 
> If you find what matters, you’ll know where to follow.
```

### Signal

> Operate quietly. Measure impact. Leave systems stronger than you found them. And always have a backup… or two. 😉

### Operational Focus

- Advanced Active Directory abuse paths and delegation scenarios
- Covert command-and-control concepts and payload delivery
- Deep kernel-level Linux hardening
- Stealth-oriented Wi-Fi post-exploitation workflows
